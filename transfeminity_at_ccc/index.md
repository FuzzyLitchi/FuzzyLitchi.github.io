# transfeminity at ccc

i think 38c3, a hacker conference, is more transfeminine than every queer event in copenhagen i've ever been to.

i'm not the only transfem there. i'm not the loudest transfem there. you can be an egg at 38c3, you don't need to be "sufficiently" removed from cis manhood to be allowed to be there. there are transfems on stage, transfems among the organisers, transfem specific sub-events, discussion of diyhrt on the main stage.

if you don't police amab's gender for fear of them being "one of the enemy", it turns out a lot of them have queerer genders than you might think. and you can learn a lot about gender from us.

i thought it was pretty magical ðŸ’– thanks to everyone who helped make it great
