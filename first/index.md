# First

I've wanted to have a blog to actually collect my thoughts places in a way that I can share with people. And I wanna be able to highlight the cool things I've done[^ctfs]. Some of the cool stuff I want to write about is CTFs, security, computing and also my soul[^soul].

## Simple

I've thought too much about cool blogs I wanted to emulate but instead I'm just gonna do something simple and managable. I'm stealing inspiration from cool people like [Lu wilson](https://www.todepond.com/) and other people who are gay.

## Things I don't like

I wish it had an automatic index of stuff I've written, maybe maybe categorized by month (since I probably won't write that much?? idk). The light mode is pretty painful to my eyes.

## Goodbye

bye!

[^ctfs]: I'm testing out how this works, I really like footnotes.
[^soul]: This is where I would write a footnote about my soul
